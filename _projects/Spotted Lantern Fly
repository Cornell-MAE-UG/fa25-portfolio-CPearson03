# Spotted Lantern Fly

**Team:** 

Spotted... then Stopped

**Client(s):** 

Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)

New York vineyard owners are trying to maximize yield in their vineyards, but Spotted Lanternflies are infesting vines and contaminating harvests, leading to decreased yield.


What challenge currently makes obvious solutions difficult to implement?
Add enough detail to narrow down the scope to the part of the problem you want to focus on.


One of the most thought of solutions would be to shake the plant enough for the bugs to fall, but there is the concern that the grapes would be lost as well. Although insecticides are normally used to control pests, this is not the most desirable solution in this case as they are both expensive and require continuous use, thus not as useful in the long term. Additionally, one issue is the vast amount of land that needs to be protected. New York state hosts approximately 35,000 acres of vineyards, all of which may be exposed to lantern flies. Another challenge is that lanternflies killed while on the vines may fall into the harvester and get mixed into the produce, which cannot be filtered due to concerns for texture and flavor. A joint study conducted by Cornell and Penn State found that 60% of lantern flies on vines wound up in the harvest bins. Current health standards require the product to be rejected if even 1-2 adults are found in a sample of 1 kilogram.
